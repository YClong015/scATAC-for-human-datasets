# scATAC-seq Pipeline Configuration Template

# 1. Project Directories (Absolute Paths Recommended)
directories:
  # Where the raw FASTQ files are located
  raw_data: "/path/to/your/raw_fastq_folder"
  
  # Main output directory for alignment and peak calling results
  processed_data: "/path/to/your/output/processed"
  
  # Final directory for Seurat/Signac analysis objects and plots
  results: "/path/to/your/output/analysis_results"
  
  # Directory for SLURM log files
  logs: "logs/"

# 2. Reference Genome Files (Hg38 Example)
reference:
  build: "hg38"
  
  # Path to the genome FASTA file (Required for BWA alignment)
  fasta: "/path/to/references/hg38/hg38.fa"
  
  # Path to the gene annotation GTF file (Required for TSS enrichment & Annotation)
  gtf: "/path/to/references/hg38/gencode.v32.annotation.gtf"
  
  # Path to chromosome sizes file (Required for bigWig conversion)
  chrom_sizes: "/path/to/references/hg38/hg38.chrom.sizes"
  
  # Path to ENCODE blacklist regions (Recommended for filtering artifact peaks)
  blacklist: "/path/to/references/hg38/hg38.blacklist.bed"

# 3. Alignment & Preprocessing Parameters
alignment:
  aligner: "bwa"
  mapq_cutoff: 30       # Minimum mapping quality to keep a read
  threads: 16           # Number of threads for alignment steps

# 4. Peak Calling (MACS2) Parameters
macs2:
  genome_size: "hs"     # 'hs' for human, 'mm' for mouse
  q_value: 0.05         # FDR cutoff
  shift: -100           # Standard shift for ATAC-seq
  extsize: 200          # Standard extension size for ATAC-seq
  keep_dup: "all"       # Duplicates are usually handled by Picard/Samtools before this

# 5. Downstream Analysis (Seurat/Signac) Parameters
qc:
  min_peaks: 500        # Minimum number of peaks per cell
  max_peaks: 30000      # Maximum number of peaks (to filter potential doublets)
  min_tss: 2.0          # Minimum TSS enrichment score
  nucleosome_signal: 4  # Maximum nucleosome signal score

integration:
  method: "harmony"     # Batch correction method
  lsi_dims: 30          # Number of dimensions for LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing)

# 6. SLURM Resource Defaults
slurm:
  partition: "general"  # Partition name on your cluster
  time: "24:00:00"      # Max runtime
  mem: "64G"            # Default memory allocation
